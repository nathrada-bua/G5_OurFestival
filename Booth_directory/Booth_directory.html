                <h3>Yen Yen bamboo</h3>
                <p>was born from a love of Thai herbal traditions and the
                    refreshing simplicity of nature. Inspired by the cooling phrase “yen
                    yen” and the rustic charm of bamboo, the stall was designed for
                    festivals and outdoor gatherings. It offers four signature drinks—Pandan
                    Cooler, Lemongrass Breeze, Longan Sweet Tea, and Fresh Coconut
                    Water—each crafted to soothe and hydrate under the tropical sun. Using
                    local ingredients and timeless recipes, Yen Yen Bamboo blends tradition
                    with modern flair, inviting everyone to pause, sip, and enjoy the gentle
                    breeze of Thai refreshment.</p>

                    flavors into every cup. “Baan” means home in Thai, and the stall
                    reflects a cozy, welcoming vibe inspired by traditional Thai
                    hospitality. Specializing in milk-based drinks, Baan Brew offers
